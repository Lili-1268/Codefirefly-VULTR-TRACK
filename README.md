# Codefirefly-VULTR-TRACK

This project helps companies find new customers more easily. Users searching for potential clients can specify the industry theyâ€™re interested in. Based on this input, the system provides relevant suggestions and displays their locations on a map. 

## Companies per sector

The LLaMA model, accessed via the GROQ API, is used to generate customer suggestions.

The specific model in use is LLaMA 3-8B-8192.

An API key for GROQ has been previously created and configured.

## MAP 

The map is generated using the OpenCage Data API, which provides geolocation information. The customer's location is then displayed on an interactive map.

## Contact search

Hunter.io is used to find contact persons within a company.
An API key allows for seamless integration with their database. By providing a domain name, the API can return the email addresses of specific individuals associated with that organization.

## Deployment 

The app is deployed using Flask on a Vultr server. The Vultr server has the following specifications:

    vCPU: 1 vCPU

    RAM: 4096 MB (4 GB)
